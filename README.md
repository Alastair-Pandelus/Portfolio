Tactical side project  (not 100% polished!)... real world prooblem used to learn Python

- .Net Scraper application, that gathers publicly available fund data and updates the database

- Python Jupyter notebook and associated libraries to use Modern Portfolio Theory on the fund universe to seek portolfios with maximum Sharpe Ratios, these are displayed graphically
